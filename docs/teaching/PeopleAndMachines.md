# People and Machines

People are tool builders.
People make and use tools all the time.

## Operating tools

Some tools, when used, need continual attention.
These tools are operated by people.

## Automation

Other tools can be set in motion and then run by themselves.

## Exercises

1. Tools that need your continual attention while you are using them: a hammer, a bicycle, an automobile.
2. Tools that you can start in motion and then they operate themselves: a dishwasher, an oven, a clothes dryer.
