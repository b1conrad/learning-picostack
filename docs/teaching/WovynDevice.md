# Wovyn device

This is a challenging lesson.

There are no exercises because the entire lesson is an extended exercise.

It is highly recommended that the teacher either do this entire lesson on their own as part of the lesson preparation, or expect to be very hands-on.

While it appears that the lesson gives step-by-step instructions, there is in fact a disconnect.

Before a student can configure their Wovyn device, they must have signed up for a PLAN account and followed the first five steps in that section of the lesson. After step 5 they will have a URL in their clipboard, and should probably take a look at it and put it in a safe place.

Then, they can follow the steps for “How to configure it” for the Wovyn device.

They should use a fairly large number of sleep seconds so as not to overwhelm their personal agent with sensor events. A good number to use is 600 (so a reading every ten minutes).

Questions? Email consultation via [ProgrammingByBruce@sanbachs.com](mailto:ProgrammingByBruce@sanbachs.com) where you can either ask your question or arrange a Zoom meeting.

The rest is somewhat open-ended. What _does_ a student want to do with temperature, pressure, and humidity readings every 10 minutes? Let me know (at the email address above) what they have in mind and I’ll give personalized suggestions.
