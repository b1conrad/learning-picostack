# Sacrament Meeting

This lesson plan was created for home schools run by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Feel free to adapt this situation to something else, like a PTA meeting.


## Learning outcomes

Your students should be able to explain the difference between the written program and the program that happens later and follows (more or less) the order of events in the written program.


## Exercises



1. For example, the invocation might be listed as “to be announced” in the written program. As the meeting happens, the person conducting will give the name of a person they have chosen to give the invocation (having hopefully gotten their agreement just before the service begins).
2. When the program has been completely written (and ready for printing copies), it is complete in that sense. After the meeting is over, the program has been completely followed and is complete in that sense.
3. One example is a playbill, the program for a stage production. Written once for each representation of a play and copies handed out to spectators at each performance.
