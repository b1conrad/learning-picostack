# Programming

Programming is a natural human behavior. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

Have you ever planned a meeting? Written instructions for crocheting something? Sent a spouse on a shopping trip with a list? Given instructions to an employee? Given students a homework assignment?

Programming. Programming. Programming.

Humans equally carry out programs: conduct a meeting according to an agenda, crocheting something, shopping with a list, following your boss’s instructions, and completing a homework assignment.

The point of this lesson is to demystify the idea of programming. Everyone does it and anyone can do it.


## Learning outcomes

Students will understand the difference between writing down instructions and following instructions written down by someone else.


## Exercises

Some are given in the student-facing chapter of the same name. No right answers. What at first seems to be a wrong answer is probably a teaching opportunity in disguise.
