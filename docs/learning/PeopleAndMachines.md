# People and Machines


## Invention

People _invent_ machines that make their lives easier.


## Operation

When used, a machine is generally _operated_ by a person. Think: a shovel, or a wheelbarrow, both of which are simple machines, or an automobile.

More complicated machines, after being started in motion by a person, work continuously and relatively without supervision. Think: an automated assembly line, or a weaving machine.


## People as machines

Sometimes people play the role of a machine. For example, “computer” used to be a job title: a person who did computations.


## Programming


### The role of will

People have free will. Nevertheless, they can be programmed. Either through brainwashing or because they are willing to follow instructions.

A machine has a fixed will, being only willing to do the things it is built or programmed to do.


### Durability

Even with the best will, people can make mistakes and are subject to fatigue. 

Machines can be built to last much longer.


### Speed

People can only work so fast, although with practice their speed might increase, it has a limit.

A machine works at a set speed (or speeds). Their speed doesn’t increase as a result of practice. Usually a machine works faster than a person (sometimes much faster).


### Accuracy

People make mistakes. _To err is human_.

A distinct advantage of machines is that they rarely make mistakes. Machines are more reliable than people in the sense that they will do only what they are built or programmed to do. 

Errors are rare to nonexistent, and fatigue is not generally a problem (although they can wear out).


### Initiative

People can show initiative and learn to do their job better.

Machines don’t show initiative.

Machines are often built with a single function, or with several functions from which the operator can choose. But many are programmable. 


### Who programs whom

People program machines, and then they or others operate them. Think: a web application, say for a bank account. 

You will learn how to program web applications, and you probably already know how to operate them.


## Future

Perhaps in the future, machines will also program machines, due to progress in artificial intelligence (AI).
